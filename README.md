# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java (AWT)

A simple, classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Java and AWT. This project is a GUI-based implementation where two players take turns placing "X" and "O" symbols on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins, while a full board with no winner results in a draw.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Click-based interaction to place moves on a 3x3 grid.
- **Automatic Win/Draw Detection**: Alerts the players when a win or draw occurs.
- **Game Reset**: After each round, the board resets for a new game.
  
## Technologies
- **Language**: Java
- **GUI Library**: AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)

This project is ideal for understanding basic Java GUI development, event handling, and implementing game logic. Perfect for beginners and anyone interested in creating small Java applications. 

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
